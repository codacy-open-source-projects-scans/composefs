Almost the entire codebase here is under the following
license terms:

SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-or-later OR Apache-2.0

There are two exceptions which have different licenses.
First, some code derived from erofs is: GPL-2.0-only OR Apache-2.0
In practice, the intersection here means that the codebase
as a whole should be treated as if it's under `GPL-2.0-only OR Apache-2.0`.

The second exception is there are small bits of code which are simply
SPDX-License-Identifier: LGPL-2.1-or-later

The following files correspond to each component license:

 - LICENSE.Apache-2.0: Apache-2.0
 - COPYING.GPL-2.0-only: GPL-2.0-only
 - COPYING.GPL-2.0-or-later: GPL-2.0-or-later
 - COPYING.LGPL-2.1-or-later: LGPL-2.1-or-later
